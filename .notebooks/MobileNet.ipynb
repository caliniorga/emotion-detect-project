    "## Image classification using MobileNet\n",
    "In essence, this code creates a model that uses a pre-trained MobileNet network for feature extraction and then adds fully connected layers for classification. The fully connected layer is the part that will be further trained to adapt to the specific data of your classification problem, while the MobileNet layers remain unchanged and are used to extract features from the images.
